          been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Docker, Inc., or (b) engage in any activity
          that interferes with or disrupts the Docker Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the

          agree to immediately take down any Content that violates the Terms, including pursuant to a take-down request
          from Docker, Inc. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from Docker, Inc. to take down
          certain Content, Docker, Inc. reserves the right to directly take down such Content or to disable
          Applications.<br><br>5.3 In the event that you become aware of any violation of the Terms by an End User of
          Applications, you shall immediately terminate such End Users’ account on your Application. Docker, Inc.
          reserves the right to disable Applications in response to a violation or suspected violation of the
          Terms.<br><br>5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Docker, Inc. has no responsibility
          to you or to any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, transmit or display while
          using the Docker Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Docker,
          Inc. may suffer) by doing so.<br><br>5.5 You agree that Docker, Inc. has no responsibility or liability for
          the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of
          the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing and backing up your
          Applications and any Content.<br><br>6. Proprietary Rights<br><br>6.1 You acknowledge and agree that Docker,
          Inc. (or Docker, Inc.’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Docker Services and,
          subject to Sections 7.6 and 8.4 below, Docker, including any intellectual property rights which relates to or
          subsists in the Docker Services or Docker (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever
          in the world those rights may exist).<br><br>6.2 Except as provided in Section 8, Docker, Inc. acknowledges
          and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to
          any Content or Applications that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Docker
          Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application
          (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).
          Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Docker, Inc., you agree that you are responsible for
          protecting and enforcing those rights and that Docker, Inc. has no obligation to do so on your
          behalf.<br><br>7. License from Docker and Restrictions<br><br>7.1 Docker, Inc. gives you a limited, personal,

          other distinctive brand features in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and
          Web site listings (including links to your website) for the purpose of advertising or publicizing your use of
          the Docker Services.<br><br>8.4 Notwithstanding anything in the Terms to the contrary, the following terms and
          conditions apply to Docker:<br>a. Docker is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License
          http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html. (For the sake of clarity, such license grant applies to pull
          requests submitted for the Docker tool itself and not for any OS images that may otherwise be stored on Github
          or the Docker Hub website and pulled via the Docker library.)<br>b. When you submit, post, upload or otherwise
          provide any software code (“Code”) via GitHub or the Docker Hub website, you are certifying that: (i) all such
          Code was created in whole or in part by you and you have the right to submit it under the open source license
          indicated in the file; (ii) your contribution of Code is based upon previous work that, to the best of your
          knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and you have the right under that license to
          submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by you, under the same open source
          license (unless you are permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or (iii)
          such contribution was provided directly to you by some other person who certified (i) or (ii) and you have not
          modified it.<br>c. You further certify that you understand and agree that Docker and your contribution to
          Docker are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information that you submit
          with it, including your sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with Docker
          or the open source license(s) involved, and you agree to promptly notify us in writing if you do not have the
          right to grant us the foregoing license to your Code.<br>d. For users posting Code on the GitHub website or
          via the Docker Hub website, you are aware that certain postings of open source encryption code are controlled
          under U.S. Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 5D002, License Exemption TSU, which requires notice
          prior to export by email to the U.S. government. Submit the notification or copy to crypt@bis.doc.gov and to
          enc@nsa.gov. You are responsible for submitting this email to the U.S. government and Section 740.13(e) of the
          Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-772. Docker shall not be distributed or
          downloaded to or in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria and shall not be distributed or downloaded to any
          person on the Denied Persons List administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Note that products which
          use encryption solely for authentication are deemed 5×992 and the prior notification is not required. For more
          information see: http://www.bis.doc.gov/encryption/question2.htm.<br><br>9. Add-ons<br><br>9.1 Docker, Inc.
          may make available through the Docker Services additional features, functionality, and services offered by its
          third-party partners (“Add-ons”). Your use of Add-ons is subject to these Terms and to the applicable fees.
          You acknowledge for each Add-on you subscribe to or purchase through the Docker Services, these Terms
          constitute a binding agreement between you and the third party licensor of that Add-on (“the Add-on Provider”)
          only. The Add-on Provider of each Add-on is solely responsible for that Add-on, the content therein, and any
          claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Add-on or your use of that Add-on. You
          acknowledge that you are purchasing the license to each Add-on from the Add-on Provider of that Add-on;
          Docker, Inc. is acting as agent for the Add-on Provider in providing each such Add-on to you; Docker, Inc. is
          not a party to the license between you and the Add-on Provider with respect to that Add-on; and Docker, Inc.
          is not responsible for that Add-on, the content therein, or any claims that you or any other party may have
          relating to that Add-on or your use of that Add-on. You acknowledge and agree that Docker, Inc. and its
          affiliates are third party beneficiaries of the agreement between you and the Add-on Provider for each Add-on,
          and that Docker, Inc. will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such
          license against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.<br><br>9.2 By subscribing to or purchasing an
          Add-on, you grant Docker, Inc. permission to share your Application, Content, and user information with the
          Add-on Provider as necessary in order to provide you the Add-on.<br><br>9.3 The license granted to you to use
          any Add-on is personal to you, and is not sublicensable to your End Users. You may not provide or resell
          Add-ons to others<br><br>10. Recommendations<br>Docker, Inc. may, and you grant us permission to, make
          recommendations via the Docker Services for products or services we think may be of interest to you based on
          your Application(s), Content, and/or use of the Docker Services. We will never make recommendations directly
          to your End Users.<br><br>11. Modification and Termination of the Docker Services and Docker<br><br>11.1

          patches, added functionality, and other enhancements.<br><br>11.2 You may terminate these Terms at any time by
          canceling your account on the Docker Services or discontinuing your use of Docker. You will not receive any
          refunds if you cancel your account.<br><br>11.3 You agree that Docker, Inc., in its sole discretion and for
          any or no reason, may terminate your account or any part thereof. You agree that any termination of your
          access to the Docker Services may be without prior notice, and you agree that Docker, Inc. will not be liable
          to you or any third party for such termination.<br><br>11.4 You are solely responsible for exporting your
          Content and Application(s) from the Docker Services prior to termination of your account for any reason,
          provided that if we terminate your account, we will provide you a reasonable opportunity to retrieve your
          Content and Application(s).<br><br>11.5 Upon any termination of the Docker Services or your account these
          Terms will also terminate, but Sections 6.1, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 18 shall continue to be effective after these
          Terms are terminated.<br><br>12. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES<br><br>12.1 NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL EXCLUDE OR

          AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL

          HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.<br><br>14. Indemnification<br>You agree to hold
          harmless and indemnify Docker, Inc., and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees,
          advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners (collectively “Docker and Partners”) from and against any third
